# HipHopAnalytics
This is a personal project in which I seek to analyze the textual content of rap songs. Some things I'll be on the lookout for include frequency of words, average length of verse, etc. 

The data is all from ohhla.com (http://ohhla.com/index.html) which is an archive of hip hop lyrics.
